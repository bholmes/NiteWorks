# SimConnect

At the moment this is a personal hacking project for MSFS 2020

It exposes the native, C API, SimConnect dll to managed code. In addition it is setup to be a client and server API
communicating over a socket.  This will allow for apps to be written on other devices to interact with the API.

IOW create mobile and IoT apps for instruments and controls  in MSFS 2020.
