#Scratchpad

Solution of random programs that I write from time to time.

## WeatherForMonth

This program was needed for a school project my daughter did. She needed to record the
weather conditions in our area for a month. We decided to use the conditions at the airport
for her project. The console program pulls the reports for the last several days and
converts the data to what she needed.
